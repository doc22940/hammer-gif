About
So this will a open-source search engine which will provide better results in a organized manner and will let users customize it however they feel like it. There will be ML (Machine Learning) invloved in this project (I will update the readme after I am done with the actual readme, this is just a draft for now).

For Now this will be entire terminal based or software based but will not be website based because I do not have money to pay for the website hosting and domain, unless you guys want to help me by sending me money then I will get a web hosting and will register a domain as well. And if I get enough money, from work (in the future) or from you guys then I will also release a mobile version of it as well :)

# Communication
We will use Slack To Communicate. If you are interested in joining then please email me: lamichhaner40@gmail.com

# Tools And Languages To Use
I want this project to be simple as possible but yet fast as well which is why most of the core functionalities will be coded in python. There might be some C/C++ but not sure about that.


# AI 

There will be an AI like Google or Siri or Alexa etc, which will search things for you when you say the following -> 

"Hey ____, Who is Donald Trump?"

or 

"Hey ____, What is the derivative of ______ ?"

Currenty The Name is Rey, but that's only temporary for now.
